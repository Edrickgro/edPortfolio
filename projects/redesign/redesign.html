                <p>This project explores the workflow of 
                    redesigning a simple website. Identifying 
                    flaw, hardening skills, analyzing accessibility 
                    flaws, and building a responsive website with prototypes 
                    are essential to the process behind UI/UX design.</p>

                    This part selects the main website of the project. 
                    Ideally, it's one that's public but not made by a large 
                    corportation (eg. Google, Facebook). For this project, 
                    8 Degrees LLC company's website was chosen. 8 Degrees is 
                    most widely known for their When2Meet software which is 
                    used by a large number of people and organizations.

                <h3>8 Degrees Overview</h3>

                <p>
                    I chose this website because When2Meet is a staple for a lot 
                    of organizations and its company website doesnâ€™t look polished 
                    or taken care of. If I had to guess, I would say this company 
                    is no longer active as of 2006.

                <h3>Identifying Problems</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Confusing interface, buttons and links blend in too well</li>
                    <li>Content is not coherent</li>
                    <li>Content isn't clear = what exactly does the company do? Is it still active?</li>
                    <li>Links are redundant - some links link to pages with one or two lines of text</li>
                    <li>Some images don't have alt text</li>
                    <li>Somve divs are not labeled correctly</li>
                    <li>Not adaptive to different sized window</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Accessibility</h3>

                <p>Two errors and 15 alerts were detected with the website. Most of them applied
                    to missing metadata such as not specifying a language or including
                    tags for sections for different sections (text or images a direct child of instead
                    of a, ..etc). I agree with these detections and would even expand it to say that
                    the different headings are not specifically defined properly.

                <h3>Low-Fidelity</h3>
                <p>
                    A low-fidelity wireframe is a great way of 
                    creating a simple outline for a design. It 
                    focuses on addressing main concerns issues with 
                    previous designs without having to focus on the 
                    finer details.

                <h3>Design Style</h3>

                <p>A style guide with clear documentation makes design work more consistent and makes working with other developers easier. This part of the project focuses on the componetns, their aesthetics, and interations.</p>

                <img src = "images/style.png" style = "max-width: 30rem;">

                <p>With this design, I decided to keep with the simple design the website had: grayscale colors, simple box designs, and a simple font. Most of my focus was on the layout. I also chose to honor the pink hue featured in the head lines of the original website.</p>

                <h3>High Fidelity</h3>

                <p>Using Figma, the website UI was designed based on the low-fidelity wireframes. Goals for this UI included simplicity, accessibility, and adaptability to different screen sizes. Annotations for "developers" for HTML containers and CSS attributes were also included.</p>
