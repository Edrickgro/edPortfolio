                <p>Designing effective and accessible UI/UX involves a process of observation, 
                    interviewing, personas, and storyboards. This project follows such process, 
                    focusing a Walmart's Kiosk Self-Checkout and its interface.

                    <p>A self-checkout kiosk is a safe interface to observe. 
                        It's public, meaning there's no weird stares when observing 
                        people, and many different types of people use it everyday. 
                        It also had multiple components to it that are important for 
                        a smooth checkout process.</p>

                        <li>Do you prefer this method (self-checkout) or regular checkout...why?</li>
                        <li>What goes through your mind when you see the layout of the screen?</li>
                        <li>Was there any point where you felt calm/rushed by the process?</li>
                        <li>If the computer acted more like a human, would you say the process
                            would have the same, less, or better effectiveness?

                    <p>This interface, which aims to assist users in checking themselves out for their groceries,
                        has a main component and two sub grids (labeled). The main section displays items and
                        their prices. The first sub section displays all scanned items and the total price and
                        the last sub displays assistive buttons that include volume and language controls.

                <p>The observation process of this is pretty simple: we need to observe people (passive)
                    using the interface and interview them (active) about their experience using the interface.

                    <li>Some users focused more on the product than the interface itself</li>
                    <li>Users often waited for the interface to respond (screen change or noise)
                        in order to continue

                <ul>
                    <li>Self-checkout is often preferred because the process is faster regardless of
                        how long the line is
                    </li>
                    <li>Based on the experience with other checkout processes, Walmart's interface can
                        bring feelings of familiarity, complacency, pressure, or nothing
                    </li>
                    <li>Most users said "humanizing" the computer would "defeat the purpose" while others mentioned
                        they like to feel like they're interacting with a human.
                    </li>
                    <li>Users view the process as "medium risk medium reward": if you know what you're doing, it could
                        be more efficient but if you make a mistake, it can be frustrating.

                    section and aren't based on one particular subject.

                    Bob (left) the Bored man doesn't necessarily hate or 
                    love grocery shopping. He just has better things to do 
                    like watching the game. This persona is based off on the 
                    nonchalant older demographic that is featured in my observations. 
                    Bob is ok with the technology but he is easily frustrated.

                    Florence (right) is a young woman who is quickly trying 
                    to meal prep before going out with friends. She is very 
                    familiary with technology but is easily flustered by large 
                    crowds. This persona is based off the younger more tech-savvy 
                    demographic I observed: despite a time constraint, this demographic 
                    is more inclined to look at the details and is more empathetic toward others.
