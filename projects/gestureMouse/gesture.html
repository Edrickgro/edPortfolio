                        GAIM (Gesture Assisted Interactive Mouse) is an accessibility tool created by me and three other peers.
                        With our limited time frame, we were challenged with making a tool that is fast enough to process 
                        different images and present an output. A glove with different shapes is processed to detect orientation
                        and move the user's mouse accordingly.
