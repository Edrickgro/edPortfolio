                I'm a dedicated CS university student based in Southern California with experience in research, outreach, and education. 
                With a unique interest in grassroots social change in and outside of software development, I explore
                sectors such as disability, education, and climate/energy. Such interests guide my dabbling into 
                different languages, frameworks, and sectors within SWE.

                In tandem with programming, I have also dedicated my life to biking and public transportation, as well as community work
                and physical arts. I believe its important to recognize the ways in much of the work that we do that is seemingly disjoint is not,
                and this principle is part of what guides my overall learning motivation.
